Easily copy files from one folder to another, ensuring they both have the same content.
Advanced Folder Synchronizer (by Lore)
Overview:
This program allows you to synchronize two folders in an advanced, flexible, and secure way. Through a simple graphical interface, it offers different synchronization modes (bidirectional, unidirectional, and mirror), conflict control, exclusions, and automation.

It is designed for users who want to keep two folders synchronized efficiently, including backups, simulation, and multi-language support.

Basic steps:
Open the program (synchro.exe or run the Python script).

Select the folders to synchronize:

Folder A.

Folder B.

Choose the synchronization mode:

Bidirectional: synchronizes in both directions.

One-way A → B: Copy only from A to B.

One-way B → A: Copy only from B to A.

Mirror Mode: Exactly replicates the contents of one folder to another, deleting non-matching files (optionally with deletion propagation).

Advanced Options:

Configure conflict resolution (prompt, overwrite, ignore, rename).

Enable or disable hash comparison.

Enable simulation mode (see changes without making them).

Exclude specific extensions or subfolders.

Enable backup before overwriting files.

Set automatic synchronization interval if desired.

Save settings for future use.

Start manual or automatic synchronization.

Supported languages:
English, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish.

Recommended Uses:
✅ Automatic personal backups.
✅ Synchronization of local folders with external drives.
✅ Maintain shared working folders between computers or local networks.
✅ Exactly mirror one folder in another (mirror mode), useful for critical backups.
✅ Advanced hash comparison to ensure the integrity of synchronized files.
✅ Simulation mode for risk-free testing.

Safety tips:
Use simulation mode when setting up new, dangerous synchronizations (especially in mirror mode with propagation of deletes).

Always enable backup before overwriting if you are unsure of the changes.

Check paths and settings before starting automatic synchronizations.
